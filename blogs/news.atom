    <title>The Future of Antique Candles...</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">When Brittany first started Antique Candle Co.® back in 2014, we didn’t have our classic Mason Jars—<strong>we had <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/antique-restock"><em>Antique</em> <em>Candles</em></a>.</strong> In fact, that's why it's in the name! Each candle was hand-poured into vintage containers that we carefully picked from antique shops and flea markets. While a lot has changed over the years, that's still how Antique Candles are made to this day. ❤️ These candles were the heartbeat of our small business, and they’re still so close to our hearts...But as time goes on and this little studio evolves, we’ve found ourselves asking: <em>Should we continue making Antique Candles? </em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Antique_Restock_BTS__image_25_600x600.png?v=1732892313" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1"></strong>For context, we restock anywhere from <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/antique-restock">50-200 Antique Candles</a> about every month. There’s still a dedicated group of candle lovers who come out to snag these extra special pieces—and we’re SO grateful for that! We've tried so many different vessels for Antiques, and some are definitely more popular than others (typically the harder ones to source...lookin' at <em>you, </em>Copper Candles! 👀). We put a lot of effort into finding these pieces, then hand cleaning and hand pouring them, and we love that...<span data-mce-fragment="1">But to be completely honest with you, Antique Candles are much more difficult to make from start to finish than some of our other products for where we are at today.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">So where does that leave Antiques? Well, it's a tough question. They’re one-of-a-kind, they’re timeless, and they’re what helped us get here. <strong>So we really are just curious: Should we keep making them, and if so, what type?</strong> Or would that time be better spent working on something new and exciting for YOU? We’re at a crossroads, and we'd really love your input to figure out the next steps.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Antique_Restock_BTS__image_10_b2134bcd-3507-43bb-b622-18c2bbd5eec4_600x600.png?v=1732892259" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>We want to hear from you!</strong> Would you miss Antique Candles if they were gone? Are there any parts of the experience (price, availability, scent, quality, etc.) that haven’t lived up to your expectations in previous Antique Restocks?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">We’d also love to know your thoughts on:</p>
<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">How often do you buy antique candles? Maybe it would make more sense to do Restocks a few times a year instead of monthly...</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">What do you love or not love about Antique Candles?</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">When was the last time you saw a promotion or advertisement from us for an Antique Restock?</li>
</ul>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">We’ve put so much care into these candles and we want to make sure they still have a place in our future, <em>IF </em>that’s what you want. Your feedback will help us shape what comes next and ensure we’re bringing you candle goodies that truly speak to what <em>you</em> love. 🙌</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Antique_Restock_BTS__image_17_600x600.png?v=1732892401" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Whether you’ve been with us from the start, or you’re just now discovering the charm of Antique Candles, we want to hear from you. 🤗 No opinion is too small, and every piece of feedback will guide us in making the best decision for our future <em>together!</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Thanks for being a part of this candle fam.</strong> Your thoughts mean the world to us!</p>

    <title>Going Home for the Holidays with Madison</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">The holidays are all about coming together with friends and family...In true ACC fashion, we asked, <em>"What does that smell like?"</em> 🤔</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">To help answer that question, we partnered with a dear friend and are excited to celebrate a brand NEW candle, <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/home-for-the-holidays-by-madison-vining"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Home for the Holidays</strong></a>, created in collaboration with the wonderful Madison Vining (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/madisonviningblog/" target="_blank">@madisonviningblog</a>)!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/AntiqueCandleCo1_600x600.jpg?v=1730488217" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Have you met Madison?</strong> She's a busy mama in a house full of kiddos and wife to her middle school sweetheart. 🥰 She is passionate about family, and truly knows how to make a house feel like a home. We first connected with Madison through her heartfelt stories about family life on her Oklahoma farm. Her love for creating inviting spaces and her commitment to using natural products perfectly align with what we believe in.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/AntiqueCandleCo9_600x600.jpg?v=1730489540" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When we started this adventure with Madison, she wanted to capture that cozy feeling of coming home at Christmas. <em>"I had in mind what I wanted it to smell like, and that is the feeling of coming home to a place that is your soft place to land, where you're accepted and loved without question." </em>🎄</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">We knew we needed something that just felt like CHRISTMAS with warm, woodsy notes and a touch of fresh fruit. After trying out a few blends, Madison instantly fell in love with <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/home-for-the-holidays-by-madison-vining"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Home for the Holidays</strong></a>. <em>Imagine a <span data-mce-fragment="1" class="author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvls4um6z83zz83zz87zz66zz72zuilz82zz81zz85zz77zz86zz83z9a2z77z5ns6kt"> homey scent of sweet citrus with refreshing apple, berry, and eucalyptus, intertwined in a nostalgic blend of balsam and woods.</span></em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvls4um6z83zz83zz87zz66zz72zuilz82zz81zz85zz77zz86zz83z9a2z77z5ns6kt"><span>Your breakdown of the notes (for candle obsessed folks like us!):</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>TOP: orange peel + sweet citrus</li>
<li>MIDDLE: red apple, holly berry, eucalyptus, + pine</li>
<li>BOTTOM: balsam fir, cedar, sandalwood, + musk</li>
</ul>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">The end result? <strong>A fragrance that feels like a warm hug</strong>, full of happy memories and the joy of making new ones together. Madison's heart shines through in this collaboration. 🤗<span data-mce-fragment="1"><br></span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>THIS CANDLE IS AVAILABLE NOW!</strong> We can’t wait for you to light up your own <strong data-mce-fragment="1">Home for the Holidays</strong> candle.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">We sent Madison's candle to dozens of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madisonviningblog/" target="_blank">@madisonviningblog</a> and Antique Candle Co.® peeps to test her scent before launch day. Here's what some real testers had to say:</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>"Made me smile every time I burned it. Just smells so cozy and clean!"</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>"My favorite...It's a very "woodsy walk" type scent. Gives leaves, a cup of tea, and pine forest vibes. A bit of mountain air and light citrus really rounds it out without being too masculine or musky!"</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>"My entire house smelled wonderful and we have a 3,800 square foot home!"</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>"Just the perfect amount of fragrance in my room, it wasn't over powering or too strong. I could defiantly smell the citrus and the pine in this one!"</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/AntiqueCandleCo17_07121038-9d49-44ad-bba7-6d1f1a698c78_600x600.jpg?v=1730489875" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/home-for-the-holidays-by-madison-vining">Home for the Holidays by Madison Vining</a> is <em>officially</em> here. (PSST...You can also smell it in the <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/monthly-candle-boxes">Monthly Candle Box</a>!) In the meantime, <strong>what does "Home for the Holidays" mean to you? 👇</strong></p>]]>

    <title>What&apos;s Your Christmas Story?</title>

    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>Twinkling lights, cheerful music, the scent of pine and spice in the air...</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Sound familiar? As the days start to grow short (and chilly ❄️), there's a special, once-a-year <em>magic</em> that signals the arrival of the holiday season. Even though some of us might not be <em>quite</em> ready for it (I'll be the first to admit I'm still living the Pumpkin life 💁‍♀️), that holiday magic is a reminder that it’s time to gather with family, share lots of laughs, and create new memories together with Christmas traditions—those little rituals that make the holidays feel <em>truly</em> special.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Untitled_design_23_d4e6cad8-2bcf-485d-9e07-9b26ed429410_600x600.png?v=1728929902"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Growing up, my family had a few traditions that still bring a smile to my face. I remember the joy of making gingerbread houses with my sister, our hands sticky with icing from our sugary masterpieces (I use "masterpieces" loosely...they were more like architectural disasters 😂). Those evenings spent sipping homemade hot cocoa with cousins while decorating Mamaw's Christmas tree—<em>50 years</em> worth of ornaments, each one with a special memory. The nights before Christmas when, even to this day, my mom gets us special pj's to get cozy in and watch <em>A Christmas Story</em>. Remember when Ralphie's "Old Man" pulled out that extra gift hidden behind the tree? <em>An Official Red Ryder carbine action two-hundred shot range model air rifle</em>...My dad recreated that scene for my sister one year and I'll never forget it! (Don't worry, we didn't shoot our eyes out. 👀)</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56%; position: relative;"><iframe class="giphy-embed" style="position: absolute;" height="100%" width="100%" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xUPOqhLgo8bXsYCav6" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-christmas-movies-a-story-xUPOqhLgo8bXsYCav6">via GIPHY</a></em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Now that I have a family of my own, this season I can't help but wonder what my daughter will look back on one day and remember as her favorite Christmas traditions. Will it be picking out a special ornament every year? Singing her favorite Christmas carols as soon as they're on the radio? Filling a shoebox for Samaritan's Purse? Or maybe it'll be celebrating the true reason for the season...</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" class="chapter-1"><em><span id="en-ASV-24973" class="text Luke-2-7">And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</span></em></div>

      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">Sweater Weather season is practically here and that means COFFEE. Coffee of every shape, flavor, or brew. We love it so much here in the candle studio that we even have a weekly espresso bar with in-house baristas! 😋 (#ThirstyThursdays!)</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">We've tried MANY coffee-inspired candle scents over the years to find the ones that were just perfect. Enter: the <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/coffee-collection"><strong>NEW Coffee Collection!</strong></a> <strong></strong>It's a collection of faves including Fresh Roasted Coffee, Pumpkin Spice Latte, and Vanilla Spice Latte. 🙌</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>But that's not all...</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Introducing: <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/fluffy-coffee"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Fluffy Coffee</strong> <strong>by Tina </strong>@<strong data-mce-fragment="1">ToMimisHouseWeGo!</strong></a> Think warm, sweet, frothy coffee at home for a special 'treat yourself' moment. With a comforting blend of almond cream, rich espresso, white chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon, Fluffy Coffee is a warm hug in a mug. ❤️</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Fluffy_Coffee__image_3_-Verticle_JPEG-2_600x600.jpg?v=1725647071" style="float: none;" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Fluffy Coffee is inspired by Tina’s love for cozy moments spent with family and her famous 'Fluffy Coffee' she makes at home! If you don't know Tina (lovingly called “Mimi” by her grandkids), she has a big heart for connecting with the people and is always looking for ways to make time together extra special. Fluffy Coffee captures that spirit of joy, indulgence, and simplicity—it reminds us of home and the playful moments of sharing something sweet with the people we cherish most.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Fluffy_Coffee__image_9_600x600.jpg?v=1725647079" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">We asked Tina how she makes 'Fluffy Coffee,' and she said, "<span data-mce-fragment="1"><i data-mce-fragment="1">My recipe is silly and it’s never the same. It’s a latte with extra milk, several pumps of flavored syrup, and whipped cream. </i>😂<i data-mce-fragment="1"> It can have sprinkles of a dusting of cinnamon!"</i></span></p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>How do <em>you</em> like your coffee?</strong> If you're a lover of sweet, creamy coffee like Tina, you can make your own cup of delicious Fluffy Coffee to pair with your candle:</p>
<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">1 shot of espresso (or more for an extra kick)</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">1 cup of steamed milk</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">3-4 pumps of your favorite flavored syrup (vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut—why choose just one?)</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">A generous swirl of whipped cream (the fluffier, the better!)</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Sprinkles or cinnamon for a finishing touch</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Instructions:</b></div>
<ol>
<li>Brew your shot of espresso and pour it into your<span> </span><i>favorite</i> mug.</li>
<li>Steam the milk, making sure to add a little extra for that silky smooth texture.</li>
<li>Stir in several pumps of flavored syrup until the aroma is as sweet as the treat.</li>
<li>Pour the steamed milk over the espresso, filling the mug almost to the top.</li>
<li>Top it off with a<span> </span><i>towering</i><span> </span>swirl of whipped cream, creating a fluffy peak.</li>
<li>Finish with a playful sprinkle of your choice—sprinkles for color or cinnamon for a cozy touch. Or go all out and do both!</li>
</ol>

      <![CDATA[<div data-mce-fragment="1" style="text-align: center;" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1"><em>Written by Allie Boss of<span> </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/alliemboss/" target="_blank">@alliemboss</a>, author of<span> </span><a href="https://www.thebossfarmhouse.com/" target="_blank">The Boss Farmhouse Blog</a></em></span></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"> </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">When Antique Candle Co.® reached out to me to see if I was interested in a collaboration, it was an immediate YES! <em>Are you kidding me?</em> A signature scent candle<em> I</em> get to choose? What a DREAM collaboration!! This whole experience has been SO much fun and I just truly feel so honored that they wanted me to represent their company, something I do not take lightly. I will say over and over how incredible this whole experience has been. Antique Candle has gone above and beyond to just make this experience so special, fun, and a true joy. Every detail is planned out and every one of the staff I have got to meet and work with are truly the kindest and most joyful people. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Allie_Visit_Day_06-24__13_600x600.png?v=1724702429"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">When we first started talking about what this candle was going to be, it was a lot of talking about what I wanted as the <em>overall feeling, smell, and direction</em> of this candle. I knew going into this what “vibe” I wanted, but goodness I had no idea so much went into creating one single scent! From chatting about the scent and testing so many combinations, to taking those through stringent testing for how they burn, if they smell like they should, how they smell warm and cold, then narrowing it down to three scents to test, we ultimately choose “the one.”</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">After many months of talking, planning, visiting the studio/ warehouse, and many many emails, <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/country-home-by-allie-boss?afmc=Alliemboss&amp;utm_campaign=Alliemboss&amp;utm_source=postaffiliate&amp;utm_medium=affiliate"><strong>Country Home by Allie Boss</strong></a> was born. So let’s go back to the beginning...</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/countryhome15_600x600.jpg?v=1724702544"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">When we first started this collaboration it was, <em>"First, what are the smells I love most? What am I most drawn to in a candle? What of their candles do I love the most?"</em> Antique Candle truly wanted this candle to be ME! For me, I wanted this candle to be a stand alone. Something that was unique, but familiar; warm, inviting, cozy, and HOME. I gave them all the scents I loved, what ones I didn’t, and we kinda had a general idea to figure out what I wanted this scent of the candle to be.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">The day I visited the studio was such a blast. A day full of talking, laughing, and getting a front row seat to everything they do, which, to be honest, is way more than I could imagine. From design teams, editing teams, scent teams, production teams, management teams, social media teams, packaging and shipping teams... They have a large team of employees that goes well beyond making some candles and selling them! During that visit I got to smell for the first time the top 3 scents to choose from and it felt like Christmas Day! </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Allie_Visit_Day_06-24__1_600x600.png?v=1724702634"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">I was sent home with 3 scents to start <em>really</em> getting to know and test out. I’ll be the first to say candles all smell different in different environments. When I took all 3 home and started filling my home with their scent, the one I chose as my least favorite out of the three ending up being exactly what I wanted once it filled my home. It had everything I asked for. It was warm and cozy with a feeling of nostalgia. It carried through my home well <em>and it felt like me.</em> The more I lit it, the more I craved it. It had a familiar scent but something so different. It was truly a feeling of <em>home</em> every time I lit it.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/countryhome21_89cc7dc8-cf47-472e-b9e8-2c11912b6667_600x600.jpg?v=1724702740"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">After I decided on the one, it was time to name it. I had been thinking about names this whole time for the candles from the very start. Originally, with this being a fall launch I was thinking of fall names. I had a bunch in mind, but the more I lit this candle I kept going back to home. This candle gives a feeling of cozy, welcoming, familiar home sweet home. I couldn’t shake the feeling that it needed to be "Country Home." My mind kept going back to it. Scents of apple, pear, and woods are like a drive through the country, and with a familiar feeling of home with the sandalwood and a bit of spice, it just fits. When I pitched the idea to Antique Candle I told them when I smell this candle I can’t help but KNOW this is a staple home scent. Not a fall scent (although amazing for fall) it has a smell that is something that works well all year round. I didn’t want to add a name that had fall in it because I wanted it to be able to be marketed for a year round home scent. I know if it was named something with fall, well, I don’t think I’d typically buy that scent come spring—haha! </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/L27A6604_600x600.jpg?v=1724702821"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727p2"><span data-mce-fragment="1" class="x_698573727s1">So here we are over five months later launching <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/country-home-by-allie-boss?afmc=Alliemboss&amp;utm_campaign=Alliemboss&amp;utm_source=postaffiliate&amp;utm_medium=affiliate"><strong>Country Home</strong></a>. Something I am BEYOND excited to share with everyone. Something I’m so proud to represent and so excited for people to fall in love with like I have, too! Here’s to feelings of a nostalgic home sweet home in the country. 🧺🐓</span></p>

    <title>Candle Testing &amp; YOU!</title>

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><meta charset="utf-8"><em><strong>We believe the best candles are those created with you in mind...</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Over the past 10 years, Antique Candle Co.® has dedicated ourselves to creating candles that bring a sense of warmth, nostalgia, and belonging into your home. But over those years we've really asked ourselves—<em>What makes us different? What makes us special? </em>The answer: <strong>YOU.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">As we enter our second decade of business (thanks to all of your love + support ❤️), our dream for Antique Candle Co.® is evolving. We are craving more of <em>YOU</em>. Your opinion, your feedback, YOUR ideas! 💡 So where does this lead us? Our goal is to make sure each candle is <em>truly</em> special to you. Through candle testing, blogs, comments, and conversations, we find out exactly what you want. We save, consider, test, and even bring to life the ideas you leave for us. Your visions are <em>never</em> overlooked. But how do we truly put the power of our candles into your hands? Two words: CANDLE. TESTING. 👏</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><img style="float: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Untitled_design_20_44f7e1bb-eb35-44e2-9c16-45325e47f166_600x600.png?v=1723828008" data-mce-style="float: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>What is candle testing?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Candle testing is the process of evaluating candles to ensure they meet your fragrance &amp; quality standards!  This involves assessing various factors such as burn time, hot + cold throw (how well the fragrance is dispersed), and overall likeness of the candle. Not only do you get to test along side us and help our candle Chemist, you get to tell us what scent to create next by voting on your favorites! 💃</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>How do we pick the fragrances to test?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Over the years, we have received <em>thousands</em> of comments, DM’s, and emails with fragrance suggestions. This is where we pull out the notepad and take note of every single idea! From there, your ideas go to our oil creators who mix up the perfect blend of fragrance notes to create <em>exactly</em> what you imagined. 💭 We have two dedicate full-time employees (shout out to Jeremiah and Taylor) who quality test each fragrance. If those fragrances burn up to our standards, they get passed along to hot throw testing<em> (hot throw is the scent of the candle while it is burning)</em>. If they pass, they then can be placed into our <strong><em>Candle Testing rounds!</em></strong>  Sometimes they are also used for <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/limited-edition-apple">limited edition scents</a> or <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/pumpkin-candles">new releases</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>How do we pick one winner?</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Hundreds, if not thousands, of candle friends will submit their feedback on the four tester fragrances that our team releases. They are asked questions like:</p>
<p><em>How satisfied are you with the scent while burning?</em></p>
<p><em>Do you think the name fits the scent?</em></p>
<p><em>Which candle of the four is your favorite?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">From these questions (and many more) we are able to take the scent with the best average of each question and name an official winner! 👑</p>

<div data-mce-fragment="1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/in-christ-alone-soy-candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/BallJars-4-24-24__image_5_600x600.jpg?v=1714411171" style="float: none;"></em></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">"In Christ Alone...”</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Growing up, I used to think the gospel was only for people who didn’t believe in Jesus. Like, somehow I’ve “been there and done that.” Or “I already know and believe this, so this is for people who don’t.” I would often tune out when the pastor would end his sermon with a call for salvation — to repent and believe in Jesus.  The good news was faithfully presented every Sunday morning and I tuned out thinking it wasn’t for me. The more I read the Bible and grew in my faith, the more I realized this kind of thinking is far from the truth. The reality is <strong data-mce-fragment="1">the gospel is for <em data-mce-fragment="1">everyone</em>,</strong> for people who have not yet put their faith in Jesus <em data-mce-fragment="1">and</em> for those that have. </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">A few years back, I read a little devotional book called “A Gospel Primer” by Milton Vincent. In it, the book offers that we can experience the gospel more fully by preaching it to ourselves every day. This is in line with Scripture, similarly when the Apostle Paul says “...continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, <strong data-mce-fragment="1">not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard</strong>” (Colossians 1:23). Think about this truth for a minute. Why would we need to preach the gospel to ourselves and why would the Apostle Paul call believers not to shift from the gospel?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I think if we are honest with ourselves, there are times in our life where we don’t believe God or we doubt His character (His power, faithfulness, goodness, mercy, etc.). There are also times when it may be harder to trust in His Word and His promises. Or times when we don’t think Jesus’ sacrifice was enough to completely make right all the wrongs we have done. In many ways, His grace sounds too good to be true. Our confidence can waver. <strong data-mce-fragment="1">To continue in the faith and remain steadfast, we need to believe the good news of Jesus is just as much for us today as it was the day we were saved. </strong>We need the gospel today and every day. </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/in-christ-alone-soy-candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/BallJars-4-24-24__image_7_600x600.jpg?v=1714411249"></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When we are filled with anxiety and the stress of life is almost too much to bear, we can be comforted that Jesus intercedes for us as our high priest and will help us in our time of need.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em data-mce-fragment="1">“For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” </em>(Hebrews 4:15-16</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When we keep falling into bad habits and temptation gets the better of us, we can be assured that Jesus has taken all of our guilt and our shame and completely removed sin’s power over us at the cross. </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em data-mce-fragment="1">“Present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.”</em> (Romans 6:12-14)</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When a chronic illness or cancer diagnosis is unexpectedly announced, we can believe that just as Christ has risen from the dead with a resurrected body, we too will be resurrected with a glorified body one day. </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em data-mce-fragment="1">“This light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,<sup data-mce-fragment="1"> </sup>as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen.”</em> (2 Corinthians 4:17-18) </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When a loved one passes away, believers can have an eternal perspective and hope because Jesus made a way for us to live forever with Him. </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em data-mce-fragment="1">“I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,<sup data-mce-fragment="1"> </sup>and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.” </em>(John 11: 25-26) </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/in-christ-alone-soy-candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/BallJars-4-24-24__image_1_-final_JPEG_export_horizontal_-2_600x600.jpg?v=1714411416"></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">You see? <strong data-mce-fragment="1">The gospel has the power to change everything. </strong>We can have hope in every situation we face because Jesus died and rose again. But how do we keep this truth top of mind and close at heart? Practically speaking, this often looks like reading the Bible (God’s Word given to us), spending time in prayer, being in community with other believers, attending and serving in a local church, and worshiping God. To me, hymns are an easy way to be reminded of the gospel truths I desperately need to hear. On the days when my circumstances make it harder to sing aloud, I let the truth-filled lyrics wash over me. I listen, I’m reminded, and I’m encouraged in my faith. My favorite hymn does this well - In Christ Alone (written in 2001 by Keith Getty and Stuart Townend). Have you heard it before? </p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/i-will-rescue-soy-candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Hymn_Bible_04-24_BTS_4_600x600.png?v=1714666768" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Psalm 91:14 <em data-mce-fragment="1">“The Lord says, ‘I will rescue those who love me, I will protect those who trust in my name.” </em>(NLT)</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">‘I don’t want to be rescued…’ That’s how I felt five years into marriage. As much as I knew I wanted to change the way I spoke to my husband degradingly, I figured I could do the changing myself…Until I realized I couldn’t. It wasn’t exactly going as I hoped. So, when that option dead-ended, I figured I would give God a shot at doing the rescuing. He might know a thing or two about that, given His history. Not so shockingly, He came through.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">And He continues to come through ever since. </strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">About 3 years ago my sister-in-law’s heart stopped a few hours after giving birth. No explanation. No warning. No answers. She needed to be rescued. Yet thousands of miles away across an ocean, what could I possibly do? So, I asked God to do the rescuing. We asked and prayed and pleaded and trusted. Three months later, she walked out those hospital doors with answers and healing.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">And He continues to come through ever since.</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/DSC00070_600x600.jpg?v=1713804402" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Then there was when our sixth son was sick. Night after night, day after day, he got no relief and struggled to breathe. We did everything we could to help. Everything we could think of, we tried. He needed to be rescued. Yet no medicine, no oil, nothing we tried seemed to make a difference. So, in the depths of the night, rocking back and forth, tears streaming down my face, I once again asked God for rescue. I knew He could because He had proven Himself faithful—not that I needed proof. Then in the dark of that room, peace covered us like a blanket as we rocked.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">And He continues to come through ever since.</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/i-will-rescue-soy-candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Hymn_Bible_Collection__image_18_600x600.png?v=1713804505" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Faithful. Good. Steady. Rescuer. Protector.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">One of the verses I repeated out loud through tears when my son was sick was Psalm 91:14. The funny part about it is that I memorized it by happenstance. I was helping my boys memorize it for a challenge they were given by my parents. So, for two months, each day we would practice a verse or two and slowly put them together. Naturally, I memorized it as well, not thinking much of it.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Until those nights came. The nights when he was so sick, and I was so exhausted that I didn’t know what else to do. When I had nothing else to pray and nowhere else to turn, I knew I needed to turn upward. The words that came off my lips were those of Psalm 91:14, <em data-mce-fragment="1">“The Lord says, ‘I will rescue those who love me. I will protect those who trust in my name.”</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/DSC09860_600x600.jpg?v=1714667028"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I’m not saying we will always get the answers we want or think we need, but the good news is <em data-mce-fragment="1">He</em> is the answer. To whatever question you have, whatever prayer you prayed, whatever tears you cried, <em data-mce-fragment="1">He answers</em>. In His good timing, which often doesn’t make sense to us, He answers. In His good ways, which sometimes don’t look so good from our perspective, He answers. God is in the unique business of rescuing and protecting, but there is a second half to that verse that is also important:</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em data-mce-fragment="1">“...I will rescue those who love me.” </em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em data-mce-fragment="1">“...I will protect those who trust in my name.” </em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">You mean we must do something, too? It seems only fair when you are in a relationship with someone that each side puts forth some effort. So, it also seems right that in our relationship with God, we do the same. Love Him. Trust Him. Know that even when things look bleak and don’t go the way we hoped, His way is going to be better than the paths we plotted and prayers we prayed for ourselves.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Our requests and prayers that we throw up to heaven can often be as loaded as a baked potato. Not sure why that came to mind—maybe I’m hungry. But the point is that what God asks of us...is minimal compared to what we ask of Him. Yet somehow, we feel like we have the harder end of the deal. Then when our situation fleshes out and we (with some hindsight) see how His hand was in it the whole time, we can quickly realize that God truly never leaves us. He just asks us to love and trust in His name.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/i-will-rescue-soy-candle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Hymn_Bible_04-24_BTS_2_600x600.png?v=1714666918"></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">So here I am. I’ve lived a little bit of life, and I can tell you from that little bit that it’s true. What God asks of us is minimal compared to what we ask of Him, and doing what He asks is worth whatever risk you might perceive.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">To love God is to allow Him to be our rescuer. </strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">To trust in His name is to know He will be our protector. </strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Once we release those two jobs from our grip, we find the freedom to truly live in Him knowing He will do it. Once you know that, it’s a lot easier to remember the next time that He is always there.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">And because I’ve seen it, I know He’ll continue to come through!</strong></p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Gardening. It has become a huge passion of mine over the last handful of years. Specifically growing a cut flower garden, but I love growing all things. Flowers, veggies, fruit. It is my happy place.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">I have found so much joy and peace walking out in the mornings with the warm summer sunshine on my face, coffee in one hand, and a basket to collect my harvest in the other. Just writing that out has me giddy for long summer days in my garden.  </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">One of my very favorite things is making bouquets of flowers and giving them to my friends and family. There is so much joy in sharing the beauty of my hard work with them. What they see is a beautiful bouquet of blooms, what I see is a labor of love and a lot of hard work to get to that point. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/7_600x600.jpg?v=1714658861"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Gardening has taught me a lot of lessons. If you have ever grown anything from a seed, then you know everything that goes into it. Planting, watering, weeding, watering, weeding, watering, weeding…. And repeat for weeks, sometimes months. Sometimes things fail and don’t come out quite like we hope. Sometimes pests come to kill things, the bunnies or deer get it, or we forget to water things for too long and they start to die. The weather, the amount of sunlight, where it’s planted, and other outside elements always affect your garden. A well-tended garden takes daily care to reap a bountiful harvest no matter the conditions. I can tell when I’ve slacked off and not tended my garden for days or weeks. The weeds come back, they look thirsty, and they are in desperate need of attention. </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong><em>“Let your roots grow down into him and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will be strong in the truth you were taught and you will overflow with thankfulness.”</em> Colossians 2:7</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/let-your-roots-grow-soy-candle?afmc=Alliemboss&amp;utm_campaign=Alliemboss&amp;utm_source=postaffiliate&amp;utm_medium=affiliate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Allie3_600x600.jpg?v=1714659143"></a></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">It takes courage to plant that seed, knowing the care it’s going to need to bring you a harvest. Just like your faith in God. There have been seasons in my life where my faith is so strong nothing will destroy it, and there have been seasons when it looked like the first year of my garden. Forgetting to water and tend to it daily. It looked sad, thirsty, filled with weeds, and quite frankly, a lot of outside elements destroyed it. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/6_3c71788e-428b-4c80-9780-ec484acd1ce8_600x600.jpg?v=1714658926"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Last year after my cut flower garden was well established, we got the heaviest downpour one night. When I went out in the morning my huge row of thousands of cosmos were laying down flat. The rain had crushed them. But since they were well established, they survived. They kept growing, they kept blooming, and they survived the storm. They grew a little funny from then on, but they survived. The storm might have left an imprint on them forever, but their foundation remained strong. They still made beautiful bouquets. If that had happened when they were just small sprouts, they would have been wiped out. They would not have survived the storm. But their roots were deep in the ground and their foundation was strong; they continued to bloom the full season.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/2_5e773b6a-1ace-4da9-b8c7-d32f4bb147e2_600x600.jpg?v=1714658994"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">It reminds me of my own faith. I’ve realized as I’ve gotten older, more and more storms come. Life is filled with disappointments, hardships, tragedy, and much more. But when our foundation is solid, our roots are deep and we tend to our relationship with the Lord daily, no storm is too big to destroy us. They may leave a mark, but it won’t break us. When I’m not in my Bible daily, when I’m not spending time in prayer, I feel it. Life seems to knock me down way easier. I feel more stressed, anxious, frustrated, annoyed. But when I’m taking the time to get into my Bible, when I’m praying and working on my relationship daily, I feel so much peace, contentment, joy, and happiness. Only those feelings come from God. </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong><em>“Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds their house on solid rock.”</em>  Matthew 7:24 </strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">It’s not always easy. It’s a daily effort to grow our relationship with the Lord. But when I look at the flowers I plant, I can’t help but truly be in awe of our magnificent creator. Have you ever just sat and looked at a flower? There are thousands of details, the colors are so vibrant, the smell is incredible and they just remind me that if God put this much time into the tiniest details of a flower, imagine how much detail he put into you, his precious child. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/3_1_600x600.jpg?v=1714659036"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong><em>“If God gives that much attention to the wildflowers, most of them never seen, don’t you think he will attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you?”</em> Luke 12:28 </strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">God cares so much for you. He wants a relationship with you. You are never too far gone for him. You are never too broken for him to fix. You are not too far for him to reach. You are never too old to build a relationship with him. </span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong><em>“Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.”</em> Galatians 6:9</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Building that solid foundation takes time, it doesn’t happen overnight. </span><span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">It takes tending and watering that relationship with the Lord daily. It takes weeding out a lot of things in life. It takes shielding our hearts from outside elements. When we water our seeds of faith well, when we give it proper care, our roots in God will grow deep and strong and we will truly reap a beautiful harvest in our lives. </span><span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">And when we fail...and we will because we are human, he’s right there waiting for us with open arms. It’s never too late to build a solid foundation for your life in Christ. Plant that seed, water it, weed it, and tend to it daily. Your roots will become solid and your harvest in life will be abundant and beautiful. </span></p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soils was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no roots. Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and  chocked the plants so they did not bear grains. Still other seeds fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced crop, multiplying thirty, sixty or even a hundred times.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Mark 4:3-8</strong></p>

    <title>What verse would you put on a candle?</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Brittany here!</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">We're taking a pause on wood wicks and working on something else you told us might be cool…I need your honest advice again!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>Quick update on Wood Wick Candles</em>: My coworkers think it’s best to put a brief pause on the development of wood wicks. We're trying to not feel defeated that we can’t nail this quite yet and might even start looking at different waxes (in the candle making world, there are hundreds of wax types and combinations). If we pause and come back to it again later, a break might be what we need. I’m sorry to disappoint you – it’s so important that the recipe is perfect!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20230424_165857522_600x600_b752f20a-4238-4ed5-b97b-b0a1f5934ada_600x600.png?v=1710360212" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20230424_165857522_600x600_b752f20a-4238-4ed5-b97b-b0a1f5934ada_600x600.png?v=1710360212" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">In the mean time, I could use some honest feedback and advice on a <strong data-mce-fragment="1">Hymnal or Bible Candle Collection</strong>. I shared the initial idea with you <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/what-should-we-create-in-2024-help-me-pick">several months ago</a> and appreciate the comments. Based on your feedback, the idea of this faith-inspired collection is definitely a real potential!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">My soul is really jazzed about a bible candle collection. This wouldn’t be the first time I incorporate elements of my personal faith into the candles…it's just been many years.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Here's an old photo of me in one of my craft fair booths—circled you can see what I called  “hymnal votives”! I would cut out pages from old hymnal books, then use sparkle Hodge Podge to create a one-of-a-kind container.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/4_1_600x600.jpg?v=1710361137"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Untitled_design_20_600x600.png?v=1710359476" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Untitled_design_20_600x600.png?v=1710359476" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I grew up singing hymns and found them encouraging as I got older. I thought others might find them encouraging, too, and they did! I had trouble keeping them in stock…but they were painfully DIY and it took me hours to make a few dozen before I even got to the candle making part! Despite that, they were special and had deeper meaning. My mother-in-law still has them displayed in her piano room.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Hey, if you are reading this and have some, would you let me know? I’d love to know they were enjoyed! It would make my heart leap!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">So all that to say, <strong>we’ve been talking about finding some encouraging scripture to pair with a candle.</strong> Perhaps a phrase or bible verse that you’d enjoy in your home.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>What do you think? What would you find encouraging? </em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>Is there a hymn or proverb that is encouraging you right now? </em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Even if you haven’t read the bible much or ever, I would love to hear your thoughts! This isn’t for me, but for <em>you</em>. I want to build a sweet treasure that fills your home with cozy smells while encouraging you and your visitors. Feel free to just Google some ideas! All ideas are welcome and honest feedback would be so, so helpful! After all, there are so many beautiful options! How do we choose just a few to start out of the <em>entire </em>Bible?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/i44KZM02_600x600.png?v=1710359788" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/i44KZM02_600x600.png?v=1710359788" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Jennifer left a comment a few months ago when I first brought up the idea. She said, “Using Bible verses- PERFECT and YAY! Here’s a heart-n-spirit-lifting verse to consider- <em data-mce-fragment="1">He has made everything beautiful in it’s time</em>… Ecc. 3:11”</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">On the same post, Chris said, “<em data-mce-fragment="1">Blank labels that we could write our own message on</em>”. Now that’s a cool idea, too!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I was talking to my coworker and we were thinking about possibly adding some extra context to each candle. Since we can only fit so much text on a label, it could be a meaningful reflection that would edify the original scripture. But really, that phrase would be in your bathroom, bedroom, living room, kitchen and would need to fit for <em>you</em>…oh!! What about something with Matthew 5? Salt &amp; light….hmm…Oh the mind wanders. See my problem? Haha!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Anyways, I think it can be scripture, but it really can be so many things. Imagine the possibilities! <em>A poem? A work of art? Encouraging phrases?</em> I’m not sure if it would be that popular, but I want it to be meaningful.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Meaningful &amp; encouraging – like the sweet aroma you fill your space with. What would that be for you?</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">------</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Oh my goodness! An idea just popped into my head as I was writing you…what if…Ok, bear with me, but what if we tried to pair some scents described in scripture with a candle? The most popular that comes to mind is Frankincense and Myrrh. Now that I think about that though, we tried it a few times. We always got mixed reviews which is why we never brought it to life. I wonder if it’s because we didn’t do well, or perhaps the earthy, ancient, more biblical scents aren’t very popular today? Hmmmm...</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Would you be willing to help us test and match scents to some encouraging scriptures found in the Bible?</strong> Would that ever be a thing that would be interesting or good to do? I’m thinking the perfume that Jesus’ feet were anointed with when he was in the pharisees house in Luke 7. Imagine meditating on that scripture while burning that same aroma next to you? Wow!! How glorious!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Or what about….</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">The smell of the Garden of Eden?? (at least before Chapter 3 of Genesis!)….Ezekiel talks about some of the precious elements that would have been included, and we know there were lots of trees and fruit! We might have to get more creative on that one.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I hope I’m not over spiritualizing this idea…it really has come to me quite recently. Would this type of testing and matching be interesting to explore together? I’ve never seen anything like this. Perhaps it is because I am around candles all the time, but I think our noses and sense of smell isn’t talked about a lot or celebrated. I think it could be a fun, new way to engage with the Bible. Again, just an idea at this point!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><em>You can also tell me this is kinda strange and to take a hike.</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>I count on you to give me the real, real!</strong> And you always do – thanks for being here, and I’ll check in with your thoughts soon!</p>]]>

    <title>Because of You...A Letter from Our Founder</title>
    <author>
      <name>Brittany Whitenack</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">Depending on the source (not all agree), 60 – 96% of businesses fail before they ever reach 10 years old. Basically, the odds aren’t great that a small business will stick around for 10 years.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I started Antique Candle Co. (formerly known as Antique Candle Works) in January 2014 – what seems like ages ago. I wrote the first email to my first candle customers at my dining room table (<a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=7c6bd2b552c02e72b9736bbbf&amp;id=53d84c5cf7" target="_blank">here is what I wrote to you</a> for Mother’s Day in 2014. Haha!), just a few feet from where I made the candles in my kitchen.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">As I write this message to you now, I am in a different house – actually, an apartment in my hometown – and just a few feet away from where I sometimes record new product videos or live demos (like how to use our <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/candle-making">refill kits</a>). Right now, I’m burning Banana Bread – a fragrance that didn’t win from a candle tester round a few years ago, but I personally loved it so much I stocked up on leftovers.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20231218_193609050_600x600.jpg?v=1702997086" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">A lot has changed and owning a business isn’t easy, <em>but I don’t think that’s why most businesses who want to be around 10 years later aren’t in business.</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I’ve had a lot of time to reflect on this past year and there is a common theme – <strong data-mce-fragment="1">you are dreaming up the next ideas with us.</strong> Of course, the only reason I get to dream about things we can craft is <em data-mce-fragment="1">because of you</em> – but I think that is too simple. That doesn’t give you enough credit for why I get to make more candles for you 10 years later.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Do you remember when I started doing candle testers in 2018? If you’ve been here a while, you know that Candle Testers (when candle friends like <em data-mce-fragment="1">you</em> vote on the next new fragrance) didn’t always exist. I actually found this super old post when we were doing a candle tester round several years back. (It’s when my personal favorite, Banana Bread, did NOT win!!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe title="2021 Archive: We will be announcing the Fall Candle Tester WINNER in just a few short days!!" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/896214265?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0"></iframe> <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">The whole Candle Testing process is so fun because I have NO IDEA which scents you’ll love or which ones you’ll score a 1 out of 10 (being, very bad). Haha! That’s a big part of what makes me appreciate you even more – you are always honest with me. You will tell me if a tomato candle is a terrible idea! I actually count on it, <strong data-mce-fragment="1">and it’s why I think we’re still in business 10 years later.</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">You’ve saved me from some pretty strange ideas. My tastes aren’t always your tastes, and that’s what began a fun journey of building this business together <em data-mce-fragment="1">with you</em>. With your input, your ideas, your comments, and yes, even your <em data-mce-fragment="1">complaints</em>, Antique Candle Co. has grown and changed for the better.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_32_12bf861d-612a-4d4d-9ae3-186f391976ba_600x600.png?v=1703002900" alt=""></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="text-decoration: line-through;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>The most valuable feedback has been both the negative and the validating feedback for new ideas. I feel like we are <em data-mce-fragment="1">doing this together</em> – we’re testing things out, choosing <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/pages/fragrances">new fragrances</a>, deciding to launch <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/room-sprays">room sprays</a>, trying to make wood wick candles work, updating the images on the online shop to be less white and easier to see, and even making shipping more affordable. (Just this year, we offered free shipping the whole year for the lower 48 states. That was a huge deal for us to do that!) I hope you also enjoyed us bringing back <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts">soy wax melts</a> and adding more <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/last-chance/Limited-Edition-Pumpkin">Pumpkin candles</a> this Fall!! Those were not in the plan, but we added it because of all the comments you shared that encouraged us to build those for you!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I had a lot of fun on all those projects, and I really appreciate your honest feedback along the way. Again – I feel like we’ve been doing this together. <strong data-mce-fragment="1">Thank you. Thank you.</strong> Thank you for caring enough to share your creative ideas, concerns, and when you don’t like a candle. It helps us know if we are on the right path.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Untitled_design_15_416e3a81-ec4d-45a2-85c3-d19a09320816_600x600.png?v=1703000474"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">As I close this chapter on the first 10 years, I wonder if a timeline and journey of this business could be fun to share – there are some highlights of some ideas that started with you. Is that something you might like to see?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Friend, thank you for sharing feedback with me over the years. I believe the Lord is supporting our mission to connect with people and reflect light back into the world with candles. I also believe that your participation and feedback on what we craft has made all the difference in why we are still here 10 years later. Thank you for loving on us, caring about what we create, and just being here. If you made it reading this far, thank you.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Thank you. Thank you.</strong></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>PS</strong> – for the first time, I started doing candle tours with customers! I haven’t made a big thing of it, but just saying ‘yes’ to those of you who reach out…The reason I started doing this is because one thing I miss about doing the craft shows is having a way to ask you questions <em data-mce-fragment="1">in person</em>. I might continue the tours, but I’m not sure…</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Do you ever get up to Lafayette, Indiana?? Purdue University is close by, so sometimes I get to meet folks from out of state that just want to visit. I must admit that our current space isn’t set up for tours (it’s pretty cramped!), so I always feel bad for those that do come for a tour. I wonder if we can build something for the future. I suppose it depends on your thoughts.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Here we go again: building something together! If we do tours in the future, what would you want to see or do? Hmmm…Oh, the possibilities!! <em>I can’t wait to hear what you think!</em></p>

      <![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;">Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights...</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>James 1:17</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Hymn-Lifestyle__image-27_70f18477-4685-4832-ab8b-be5b0dc5f578_600x600.png?v=1701203299" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Christmas is <em>almost </em>here!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's a time of thanks and giving, family traditions, love, joy, and so much more. Every Sunday this December, we take time to reflect on the true reason for the season, <strong>Jesus Christ,</strong> with Christmas Advent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Advent is a time leading up to Christmas when we light a candle that symbolizes one of the most important parts of the holiday and Christ's unconditional love for us. It's a season to celebrate the wait and preparation for the Nativity of Jesus and His return!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Hymn-Lifestyle__image-22_600x600.png?v=1701203631" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We honor advent using candles, which are near and dear to our hearts<span>!</span> For us, Christmas Advent is also a beautiful way to bring praise to God with the very candles He has blessed us with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Join us as we celebrate this Christmas Advent!</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">1st Sunday of Advent: hope</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_24_1_600x600.png?v=1701204458" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned...</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For to us a child is born, to us a Son is given...And He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Isaiah 9:2+6 </h4>
<p><strong>The Prophet's Candle.</strong> We can remain strong in our hope that dark days cannot last when an overwhelming light in Jesus is always there. It was prophesied that a child would be born to save the world, and we celebrate that great news on Christmas Day!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">2nd Sunday of Advent: faith</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_3_52c004aa-4063-477d-87e1-2f1b33601c27_600x600.png?v=1701205233" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God...For no word from God will ever fail."</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Luke 1:31-37</h4>
<p><strong>Bethlehem's Candle.</strong> It is faith that the impossible can be made real through Jesus. He can move mountains, overcome any obstacle, and save us from our sins when we believe in Him. Just as Mary placed her faith in God's Word, so should we.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em></em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em></em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em></em></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">3rd Sunday of Advent: joy</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Sugar_Cookie-7_600x600.png?v=1701205567" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Then the angel said to them,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger."</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!"</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Luke 2:10-14</h4>
<p><strong>The Shepherd's Candle.</strong> Good Tidings of GREAT JOY! What a celebration is Christ's birth! This is the moment, now and forever, we are saved. This is the joy we experience throughout the year and during the holiday season. We are saved!</p>
<h3>Final Sunday of Advent: love</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_6_6c90d2d4-d00d-4c55-a504-970b9df4d81b_600x600.png?v=1701205863" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">John 3:16</h4>
<p><strong>The Angel's Candle.</strong> Christmas Day is about God's love. He gave us Jesus, God in the flesh, to walk with us and rescue us from sin. Christ prepared our way; all we have to do is have hope and faith in Him. His love does the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/BB4A9863_600x600.png?v=1701206126" alt=""></p>
<p>This holiday, remember to take time to reflect on advent and celebrate the reason for the season. Thank you for joining us to celebrate this most wonderful time of the year!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Merry Christmas, friends!</h3>

    <title>soy wax melts and how to use them</title>
    <author>
      <name>Jaycie Tierney</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>At Antique Candle Co.<span>®</span>, our main focus is<span> <em>candles</em></span>. 🕯 Whether they are poured into classic<span> </span><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/mason-jar-collection">Mason Jars</a><span> </span>or unique <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/antiquerestock">Antiques</a>, much of our time is spent preparing beautiful candles to be sent right to your door.</p>
<p>However, we understand that amazing fragrance can come in MANY forms. Maybe it's because we spend <em>so</em> much time in this space, but it seems like there is always something new to discover in the world of fragrance...</p>
<p>We dipped our toes in the water (so to speak!) to bring high quality, cozy smells into your home however <em>you</em> want it! Which is why we're oh so in love with <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts"><strong>soy wax melts</strong></a>. ❤️</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/4H6A2215_2_600x600.png?v=1698435007" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p>Also sometimes referred to as "tarts,"<span> you've probably seen these packaged in little plastic 'shells' in the department store or your favorite boutique. In fact, we <em>used to</em> package them that way, too! However, we wanted to reimagine this amazing product to include MORE of your favorite fragrance, be totally mess-free, and easier to store! The newly redesigned look does just that. <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts"><strong>Soy Wax Melts</strong></a> are PERFECT for friends who</span> love the benefit of having a flameless, smokeless scent! 🥰</p>
<p>Wax melts can fill a home with<span> </span>your favorite<span> </span><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/pages/fragrances">fragrances</a><span> </span>just like a<span> </span>candle! Both are made with our quality fragrance oil and natural<span> </span>soy wax. The only difference?<em> How they are used.</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/soy_wax_melts-2_600x600.png?v=1698435356" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p>Wax melts are not actually burned. They are melted using a <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts/warmer">fragrance warmer</a> specially made for wax. You can find these at just about anywhere that also carries melts, but we picked out a few of <strong><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts/warmer">our favorites</a></strong> we think you'll love. 😉</p>
<p><em>DO NOT use a crockpot, coffee warmer, stove top, or anything that is not specifically made to be used with wax melts, and read the packaging carefully to make sure you are using the right product!</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/soy_wax_melts-5_600x600.png?v=1698435895" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p><strong>Once you have a warmer, it’s time to add the melts! 🙌</strong></p>
<p>Warmers typically have a ceramic or silicone dish on top of the heat source; this is where you put your melts. <em>Do not<span> </span></em>add water or anything besides the wax melts into<span> </span>your<span> </span>warmer. </p>
<p>We recommend pouring <strong>6-10 of our mini wax melt cubes</strong> onto your<span> </span>warmer dish to start. Adjust the amount depending on your warmer size or preference, but try not to overfill your warmer. You do not want the wax to overflow once it melts!</p>
<p>Next, just sit back, relax, and enjoy as the aroma fills the room! 😋</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/soy_wax_melts_600x600.png?v=1698436233" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p><strong>6-10 mini melt cubes can 'burn' for up to about 13<span> </span>HOURS.</strong><span> </span>That’s 13 hours of relaxation, warm thoughts, and a happy home!</p>
<p>When you're ready to remove old melts from your warmer, turn your warmer off. <em><strong>Use</strong> <strong>cotton balls</strong></em> to safely soak up the melted wax and wipe your warmer dish clean. Do not touch the hot, melted wax with your bare hands. If you are using a silicone "flip dish" with your warmer, turn the warmer off and allow the wax to cool completely before popping the wax out of the dish. Easy peasy!</p>
<p>If you were unsure about out soy wax melts, what they are, or how to use them, we hope this helped shed some light on how easy and effective melts can be. ❤</p>

    <title>How To: Candle Refill Kit</title>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: center;">HEY THERE, CANDLE MAKER! 👋</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Product-Refill_Kits_updated___image_6_600x600.png?v=1694195460"></div>
<p>You've snagged your <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/candle-making">Candle Making Kit</a>, you have the most <em>beautiful</em> container to fill, and you've texted all of your besties to come make some candles...now what?! Before you get started, you'll want to make sure you've laid out ALL of the essentials for the candle making process. All of these tools can be found in your kit to help you get started:</p>
<p>✨ Scented Wax (in 8 oz bags)<br>✨ Wicks<br>✨ Wick Stickers</p>
<p>Depending on <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/candle-making" target="_blank">the kit</a> you purchased, you might have some extras such as a metal pitcher, wick straighteners, wooden spoons, or even the cutest lil' aprons! If these didn't come in your kit, no worries! Feel free to use what you have at home and on hand.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/images__image_8_1024x1024.png?v=1673620586" style="float: none;"></div>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Step 1: Cleaning</h1>
<p>If you are re-using a used antique candle or mason jar, you'll want to make sure your jar is fresh &amp; squeaky clean for your new candle! 🧼 If it's an old mason jar or vessel from us, start by soaking the interior of the jar in hot water until the glue at the base of the wick becomes soft and any remaining wax residue melts. Scrub and repeat until the glue and wax residue is completely removed. Next, hand wash your vessel with degreaser soap and dry.</p>
<p>If you have a brand new vessel, just rinse it out with warm water! Here are some guidelines to ensure your candle vessel will work to be made into a brand new candle:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vessel Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>DO USE:</p>
<p>✓ Container that's 3" - 7" in height; at least 3" base diameter (for single wick)</p>
<p><span>✓ Fireproof material (glazed ceramic, sturdy glass, sealed metal tins, enamel, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Container with no holes or cracks that could cause leakage</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Container with a flat, sturdy base that will not tip</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>DO NOT USE:</span></p>
<p>✕ Porous materials such as unglazed ceramics or terra cotta</p>
<p><span>✕ Flammable materials such as wood or plastic</span></p>
<p><span>✕ Unsealed container (unable to hold water)</span></p>
<p><span>✕ Container with an uneven base that easily leans or tips</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_4_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1673625067" style="float: none;"></div>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Step 2: Wicking</h1>
<p>Place your sparklin' clean vessel on a flat level surface and grab your wicks! Place the sticker you received on the bottom of your wick and press the wick into the bottom of the jar, making sure it's as centered as possible. It's important to keep the wick 3.5" away from the container. If you have a larger vessel that requires 2+ wicks, make sure to space out the wicks 2" from each other. This helps ensure a safe, even burn. Congrats...you just wicked your very own candle, friend! 🎉</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_10_1024x1024.jpg?v=1673625102" style="float: none;"></div>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Step 3: Melting + Pouring </h1>
<p>Now, it's time for the REAL fun! Place a non-stick pot onto your stove and turn it on <strong>low heat</strong>. (DO NOT microwave your wax bags to melt the wax.) Grab a spoon and stir constantly until the wax is completely melted. Using a pot that has a pour spout is going to be easiest, or you can transfer the wax to a non-stick/glass pitcher. If you don't have one, you can snag one in our <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/candle-making"><strong>Candle Making Kit</strong></a>. Next, slowly (but FULLY committed 🤣) pour the wax into your jar!</p>
<p>You'll need to leave at least 1" of space on the top for the wick. Pull your wick straight and use a wick straightener to hold it in place until the candle fully cures. If you don't have a wick straightener on hand, you can snag one <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/wick-straighteners" target="_blank">here</a> (or we have been known to use a pencil or two in a pinch). Once the candle is fully cured (24-48 hours after pouring), trim those wicks to about 1/2" before burning. <strong><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/accessories/products/wick-trimmer">Our wick trimmers</a></strong> help keep your candle clean and burn evenly from start to finish. Voila! 👌</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Glass_lifestyle__image_1_1024x1024.png?v=1673625297" style="float: none;"></div>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Step 4: Enjoy! </h1>
<p>CONGRATS! 🎉 You just made your very own CANDLE! But don't forget: candle care doesn't just stop once the candle is made...nope! <strong><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/accessories">Candle care accessories</a></strong> like snuffers or wick dippers help safely extinguish a flame, keep your candle clean, and keep it burning evenly. 🔥 For all the deets on how to properly care for your candle once it's created, check out "<em><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-candle">how to get the most out of your candle</a></em>" blog!</p>

    <title>Have you met Tina?!</title>
    <author>
      <name>Brittany Whitenack</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">Hey friend! Brittany here. 👋 I’m coming to you just a few short weeks before the launch of an incredible new fragrance–<strong>Vanilla Spice Latte by To Mimi’s House We Go!</strong> It’s been an incredible project.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Tina_Visit_Day-5_600x600.png?v=1697054591"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Tina is a Mimi behind the IG account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/to_mimishousewego/" target="_blank">@to_mimishousewego</a>. ❤️ Her grandbabies call her “Mimi”–the heart behind what she is about. We met years ago online and she’s personally visited my candle business <em>multiple times</em> over the years! She jumps on a plane to fly all the way to Indiana from Texas, which means a lot to me. I treasure her kindness and investment in faithful, small businesses like us.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When we were driving in a car during her last visit, she shared more about her goals behind why she started her IG account and why she continues to share her life: <em>to give back to her kids &amp; grandbabies.</em> She has a generous heart to connect with people, as you know if you already are friends and followers of @to_mimishousewego. Her big motivator is to treat the ones that call her “Mimi” to joys in life, especially when they go to Mimi’s House. She talked about some of the things she gifted them for back to school and the memorable times they spend together. She's a loving grandma that shares her life and it’s not 'Instagram glorious.' It’s real life–sharing Amazon favorites for surgery recovery, recipes to make, recipes to avoid, and how to find a strong candle (the mild ones just don’t do 😉).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Tina_Visit_Day-7_600x600.png?v=1697054648"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Funny enough, when we hopped on a call earlier this year to kick off creating a candle together, she said very clearly:</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">“My candle needs to be <strong>STRONG</strong>. The fragrance aroma needs to FILL a room and be AMAZING and STRONG.”  We went on to talk about top notes, middle notes, fragrance profiles, and her dream candle. We spent most of the conversation around coffee, espresso, latte, vanilla, and cozy vibes. The ethos of what she was trying to create was what she shares in her home: cozy, welcoming spaces.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Tina_Visit_Day-2_600x600.png?v=1697054691"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">One thing that isn't well known by the casual candle shopper is that the soy wax naturally doesn’t hold as much fragrance oil as other artificial candle wax alternatives (what the 'big boys' use). Natural soy wax candles last longer and burn cleaner, but also are typically a little more mild due to the fragrance “load” the wax can hold. The only way around this (without using the unnatural waxes) is to be very specific with the notes and flavors of the candle...</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Which brings us to Vanilla Spice Latte.</strong> It is STRONG and packs a deliciously spiced, espresso punch to fill your home. If you love a STRONG, yummy aroma in minutes, this one's for you! 😋</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Imagine the spiced scent of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger with a cozy, warm blend of fresh espresso and maple brown sugar, topped off with sweet vanilla cream.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Your breakdown of the notes (for my candle obsessed folks like me!):</p>
<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Top notes: Cinnamon Spice</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Middle notes: brown sugar</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Bottom notes: espresso &amp; vanilla—this is the best part!</li>

<p data-mce-fragment="1">We sent Tina's candle to hundreds of @to_mimishousewego and Antique Candle Co.® peeps to test her fragrance before launch day as candle “reviewers." If you are curious about becoming an Antique Candle Co.® tester in the future, you can read more about that <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/how-to-be-a-candle-tester" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. Here is what some real testers had to say:</p>
<p><em>"Vanilla Spice Latte was delicious smelling and made me think of wrapping up in a warm blanket and reading around a fireplace and drinking coffee!"</em></p>
<p><em>"It was by far my favorite! The hot throw was so surprising! Warm and spicy scent with the perfect strength of throw when burning!"</em></p>
<p><em>"An unexpected surprise. It was very unique to any other scent I have ever smelled. I really liked it."</em></p>
<p><em>"It smells spicy and cozy. It was a traditional holiday smell, but it also reminded me of fall."</em></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The most wonderful time of the year is finally here and we've got some <em>extra fun</em> plans in store for our candle friends. Just when you think there's nothing new to share...we may just surprise ya. 😉</p>
<p>To kick off the season: <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/christmas-candles"><strong>Christmas candles are BACK</strong></a> <strong>on October 5th</strong>! That means all your faves including Christmas Day, Spiced Cranberry, and yes, even <em>Tree Farm</em>, are finally restocked for the holidays. But that's not all...</p>
<p>You may remember at the very end of last year we did some Christmas Cookie Candle Testing to <em>finally </em>add a sweet, delicious, freshly baked cookie candle to our holiday collection. Well, <em>hundreds </em>of candle friends cast their votes and the newest Christmas candle is:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Product-Sugar_Cookie__image_2_-final_PNG_export-2_600x600.png?v=1695041521"></div>
<p><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/sugar-cookie">Sugar Cookie</a>! It's a <span class="author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvls4um6z83zz83zz87zz66zz72zuilz82zz81zz85zz77zz86zz83z9a2z77z5ns6kt" data-mce-fragment="1">sweet, creamy aroma of vanilla cookies topped with marshmallow buttercream. <span data-mce-fragment="1">At first sniff, you’ll be taken back to winter days spent in the kitchen baking homemade treats with family. It’s </span><em data-mce-fragment="1">almost </em><span data-mce-fragment="1">good enough to eat (almost…please don’t <em>really</em> eat it! 😅)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvls4um6z83zz83zz87zz66zz72zuilz82zz81zz85zz77zz86zz83z9a2z77z5ns6kt" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Previously called "Marshmallow Cream Cookie," Sugar Cookie is hittin' us in all the feels. Did you used to bake cookies with your mom (or your kids) on Christmas Eve to get ready for that all-important visit from the MAN himself? 🎅 When I was little, we made different cookies every year and even laid out some carrots for the reindeer. The next morning, the plate was always empty except for a few half-eaten cookies and carrots...For a five-year-old, that was so special. What was your 'Christmas Magic' moment as a kid?? This candle might just bring back some memories...</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_8_fe5d2523-e55c-4e6b-9acb-07c189d7f067_600x600.png?v=1695044438"></div>
<p><strong>Need a little more help envisioning the scent?</strong> Here’s what a few real candle testers had to say:</p>
<p><em>“The most delicious sweet and gooey baked cookie with a toasted marshmallow on top.”</em></p>
<p><em>“This is absolutely my favorite one. This brought me back to my Granny’s kitchen and made me miss her and brought back sweet memories!”</em></p>
<p><em>“I loved the marshmallow, fluffy scent mixed with the warm, scent of a freshly baked sugar cookie. It was heavenly.”</em></p>
<p><em>“A fun twist on classic vanilla which you guys do so well! I have not liked marshmallow scents in other candle brands but THIS! It was mild, not too sweet, and had a great throw…It is THE BOMB!”</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Pictures__image_56_600x600.png?v=1695044564"></div>
<p>﻿Give Sugar Cookie a try in 16 oz, 8 oz, Bundles, Sample Packs, Wax Melts, and more on October 5th! I personally recommend trying out the Christmas Bundle of Four to save $15 on Sugar Cookie plus three best-selling favorites. 🙌</p>

      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">Hey friend! How are ya? <span data-mce-fragment="1">It’s Brittany here – owner &amp; founder of Antique Candle Co.®. 👋</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/IMG_4131_600x600.jpg?v=1695300345"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I just wanted to pop-in to give you some newsletter updates of what's been happening at the candle studio these past couple months. I must say,<em> thank you again</em> for all your feedback on the <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/what-candle-should-we-create-next-please-help-me-pick" target="_blank">Pumpkin Candles &amp; Soy Wax Melts</a>. When I asked for your thoughts about new products to work on, “Bring back wax melts” was heard loud and clear. It took a few months, but we officially brought them back <strong><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts" target="_blank">better than ever</a></strong>! (Whoohoo!)</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Also, the new Pumpkin candles have been arriving in your home. I love seeing all the photos! <em>How are you liking the scents we picked out together?</em> Remember, <strong>you</strong> told me what we should do: Pumpkin Spice Latte, Pumpkin Bread, and Pumpkin Apple were your top choices! Would you mind letting me know in a product review <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/limited-edition-pumpkin" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>? I’d love to hear your thoughts and I know other candle shopping friends would appreciate your honest feedback! As you know, it’s hard to “smell” a candle online. They haven’t invented smell-o-gram yet. 😉 I seriously LOVE all the Pumpkin smells that are filling the studio on the daily here, but I think my biggest regret is not doing Pecan Pumpkin Waffles...it was a close runner up, so I’ll need to add that to the list for Fall 2024.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/IMG_4132_600x600.jpg?v=1695300386"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">You also might have noticed we haven’t launched wood wick candles. After multiple rounds of testing, we still haven’t nailed the recipe yet. Who knew that simply changing a wick would be so complicated? Well, as a candle maker for 10 years, I must admit that <strong>candle making is as much as a science as it is an art.</strong> This has got me feeling stumped and honestly a bit defeated, but I’m still determined to find the right recipe. I want a wick that crackles LOUD enough, I still want to use soy wax (it’s the BEST!), and I want the fragrance to still FILL UP a room. I'm having trouble nailing <em data-mce-fragment="1">all three</em>, but am determined to work on this more in the New Year after the busy candle season that we find ourselves in. <em>Have you ever found yourself hitting a wall creatively?</em> What do you do to help? Part of me thinks I should start completely from scratch and try to create wood wicks in an entirely new way! Any ideas?</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/IMG_4130_600x600.jpg?v=1695300427" alt=""></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">While I’m busy helping pack orders and make candles for you<strong data-mce-fragment="1">, I find my mind wandering to next year and even the year after that.</strong> Outside of wood wicks, what else should we create? I hope you don’t mind me sharing my crazy ideas with you like last time! I’d love to hear which one sounds the most interesting TO YOU so I know to keep it on my list.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Ok, some are pretty funny or might seem a little <em>out there</em>. Please don’t judge me. Haha! 😅 I’m just dreamin' and want you to dream with me, friend! What would make our homes cozy, warm, and relaxing? Hmm….<strong data-mce-fragment="1">Can you list your top 3 ideas in order in the comments?</strong> I’d love to know your honest thoughts so we can get to work in the New Year!!! 😊</p>
<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Two-wick &amp; Three-wick candles. </strong>This is sort of already in the works, but only in the very early stage. We still need your help...what should these candle vessels even look like? The possibilities seem endless!</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/42466b471e6616293ff15e5a1945b84b_600x600.jpg?v=1695237609"></div>
<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Wood wicks. </strong>We WILL figure out the wood wicks and nail the recipe! (Positive thoughts, Brittany, positive thoughts... 😆)</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Hymn Collection or Bible Verse Collection</strong> (THINK: labels with an encouraging scripture or powerful hymn!). "Holy, Holy, Holy" or "The old Rugged Cross". Or even "It is well with my soul". The ideas are endless with this &amp; the Holy Spirit is tugging on me to do this. But how to choose from all His word? </li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Mandle!!</strong> Haha, I have had SO MANY people ask about a 'manly-scented mandle' since they became popular. TBH, I don’t know how I feel about this, but I think it could be fun to play in this realm for a limited-time run or something.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">
<strong>Taper candles.</strong> This one has me the most dreamy-eyed. Imagine vintage or antique candle holders in your homes!</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Screenshot_2023-09-20_152608_600x600.png?v=1695238008"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">What do you think? What candles should we bring to life in the new year? Any thoughts on new fragrances, too?</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"> </p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Let me know in the comments.</strong> 👇 <strong>What are your top three favorite ideas ranked in order?</strong> Thank you, friend. I can't WAIT to find out!!</p>]]>

    <title>The New Fall Candle Is...🔥</title>
    <author>
      <name>Jaycie Tierney</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span data-mce-fragment="1">We wanted to personally thank ALL Candle Testers that tested four potential Fall fragrances in your homes the past month! We had SO much fun reading through your rankings, comments, and suggestions. The survey officially ended and we collected TONS of feedback and votes as they came—each one counts!</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1">With nearly 1,300 votes on the Fall Candle Tester survey (AMAZING turnout!!), the results were clear...</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/fireside-4_600x600.jpg?v=1694112803" alt="" style="float: none;" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/fireside"><strong>Fireside</strong></a> has officially joined our Fall Candle Collection! 🔥</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1">Fireside is a nostalgic scent of crackling woodfire with vibrant blends of pine, frankincense, and oakmoss, highlighted with cozy cedarwood, smoked sandalwood, and warm vanilla.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1">When we say this may just be our <em>most luxurious candle ever</em>, that's no exaggeration. Fireside is earthy, but warm; it's fresh and soothing, but cozy. It's a sophisticated, blended fragrance that lets your mind wander to your favorite memories...whether that's chatting around a bonfire out at your grandparent's house, or snuggled up by a fireplace with your love on a cool night. It's one of those scents that instantly takes you to a happy place. It's pulling at our heartstrings and we can't get enough of it.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/fireside-2-vertical_600x600.jpg?v=1694114975" alt="" style="float: none;" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Here's what you can expect from Fireside, straight from <em>real </em>candle testers:</strong><br><br><em>"Fireside reminded me of a camp fire or the wood stove we had as a kid. I absolutely LOVE it and all its coziness! It pairs well with Autumn Woods and Mommas Kitchen! Sooooo cozy!"</em><br><br><em>"It’s in the name! It takes me back to bonfires at my grandparents vacation home in the woods, as a child. I love bonfires, so this candle is my spirit candle, it’s at the top with Momma’s Kitchen!"</em><br><br><em>"Lovely smells of burning fire and pine. Not too strong of fire, but the perfect blend. If you like a neutral/manly scent, this is for you. But don’t pass if you like the bakery smells. This suits all!"</em><br><br><em>"Nostalgic...like I'm sitting beside a campfire sharing a glass of wine with my father-in-law."</em></span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/fireside-5_600x600.jpg?v=1694115276" alt="" style="float: none;" data-mce-style="float: none;"></div>
<p>Nearly 1,300 candle testers loved the quality of Fireside with a satisfaction score that pulled out above the rest! <span data-mce-fragment="1">For the throw strength (how strong the candle is), they also noted this is a </span><em data-mce-fragment="1">moderate</em><span data-mce-fragment="1"> fragrance—right in the sweet spot for many candles. It's <em>just right</em> in all the right ways!</span></p>

    <title>Let&apos;s (Pumpkin) Spice Things Up!</title>
    <author>
      <name>Jaycie Tierney</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>It all started back in April when Brittany, owner and founder of Antique Candle Co.®, asked you a simple question:</p>
<p><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/what-candle-should-we-create-next-please-help-me-pick" target="_blank"><em>"What should we craft next?"</em></a></p>
<p>We were overwhelmed and just <em>wowed </em>to see over 500 people respond with amazing ideas. Talk about inspirational—when you're passionate about something, you don't hold back and we LOVE it! We took all of your thoughts and found 3 projects that really stood out to us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-wick &amp; wood wick candles (wick it...wick it GOOD!)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wax Melts (bring 'em back!)</strong></li>
<li><strong>MORE Pumpkin candles (there's no such thing as too much pumpkin!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your feedback directly led our teams' projects for the last 4 months! It's been so fun to work on things we <em>know</em> you'll love...it's like we're the genie here to grant your 3 wishes. Trust me, we've been hard at work to do just that!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/untitled-6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1692721709" alt=""></p>
<p>Multi-wick and wood wick candles are in the works! This is a tricky one to perfect...but <em>perfect</em> is the only way to do it! Crossing our fingers to get this just right for ya, maybe within the next year?? Time will tell!</p>
<p>You'll be <em>so</em> happy to know that <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/soy-wax-melts" target="_blank">WAX MELTS ARE BACK</a>, BABY! You spoke, we listened, and now they're here better than ever. Now you'll get <em>more</em> melts and <em>more </em>fragrance in clean, classy, unique packaging that's totally mess-free. After almost 2 years without melts, we're seriously pumped about this one!</p>
<p><strong>That leaves PUMPKIN.</strong> Let me tell ya, we've really spiced things up (<em>pumpkin</em> spice, that is...HA! Too much??) You may have seen our <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/and-the-new-pumpkin-candles-are" target="_blank">previous blog</a> about the pumpkin candles we narrowed it down to. There were five scents...but we could only launch the <em>top 3.</em> Well, the moment we've all been waiting for is finally here. <strong>Ready for wish #3?</strong></p>

    <title>Have you met our friend, Karlee??</title>

      <![CDATA[<p data-mce-fragment="1">Hey, sweet friend—Brittany here! 👋</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">As I sit here typing this letter to you, I’m basking in ALL the smells of Fall. We are as busy as bees here, not making honey, but a ton of delicious smelling candles. Oh man, I wish you were here! Would you ever consider visiting if I opened up the candle space? Let me know by leaving a comment. Perhaps we should do a Fall Open House someday! It could be a lot of fun—some food trucks, tons of yummy candles, and you could see the candles being made (and who knows, maybe make some for yourself?). Okay…I'm getting ahead of myself, but what do you think???</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Styled_Production_BTS_Shoot__image_78_d91435b8-e2b3-4694-a75d-6b8ec3959938_600x600.png?v=1692727915" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Okay, onto the real reason I’m writing this letter to you...<strong>Have you met <a href="https://www.instagram.com/karleegailbowman/" target="_blank">Karlee Bowman</a> yet?</strong></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">She’s a sweet southern soul who has been kind enough to share about Antique Candle Co.® for many years. I wanted to introduce you to her in case you haven’t met yet or heard the news, so guess what...<em><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/spice-cake-by-karlee-gail-bowman" target="_blank">We made a candle with her!!</a> </em>🥳</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Karlee-091_1024x1024.png?v=1692728019" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>We launched <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/spice-cake-by-karlee-gail-bowman" target="_blank">SPICE CAKE by Karlee Gail Bowman</a>.</strong> It’s her <em>dream</em> fragrance. It took awhile for us to find the right scent, though. Earlier in the year when I talked to her about what the project, I asked about the ideas she had. She was fallin’ in love with the idea of doing <em>a delicious, sweet, bake-y fragrance.</em> The way she was describing it had my mouth watering!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Karlee said something along the lines of, “Hey…I happen to make this cake in the Fall. It’s called Spice Cake—it makes the whole house smell AMAZING!! It has cinnamon, nutmeg, and the icing has cream cheese, brown sugar...”</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">I was getting excited at this point and said, “WOW!! I’ve never thought about doing a cake candle before…We have some bake-y candles, but not a full-on delicious, cinnamon-y Fall cake. My mouth is watering already. What ingredients do you use?”</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Karlee just laughed!</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">“Oh girl, it’s a BOX CAKE. Like, I’m just keeping it real. It tastes amazing &amp; smells amazing…The smell is sooo good, but it’s not like I make it from scratch.” She replied in her southern accent.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Then I laughed. <strong>This is Karlee—sweet as they come and down to earth.</strong> She encourages me by sharing how to create a cozy home no matter what stage of life you are in, and how you don’t have to be in your dream home to enjoy the small things. Isn’t that the truth? It’s inspiring and something I’ve always appreciated about her.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Karlee-080_600x600.png?v=1692728104" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Her idea for this candle was wonderful and building this with her has been an absolute joy. I CAN'T WAIT for you to experience this aroma that has been carefully crafted to smell like the perfect Spice Cake…even if it's inspired from a box cake. You can’t tell. 😉</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">So, all this to say, I’m beyond excited that this candle and fragrance she dreamed up was brought to life. The candle place smells like <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/spice-cake-by-karlee-gail-bowman" target="_blank">Spice Cake</a> because it's available <em>NOW!</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Karlee-076_600x600.png?v=1692728349" style="float: none;"></div>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Spice Cake by Karlee Gail Bowman:</strong> <em>A cozy scent of spiced vanilla cake, intertwined with a warm, sweet medley of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and hazelnut.</em></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">You can order Spice Cake exclusively on antiquecandleco.com. We're on the edge of our seats to find out what you think!! ❤️</p>

Remember when we asked for 1,000 candle testers to test five amazing scents with Sarah at <a href="https://modernfarmhousefamily.com/">Modern Farmhouse Family</a>? We have officially decided on a WINNER... 🥁</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/FF_Announcement_480x480.png?v=1689364840"></div>
<p class="p1"> <strong>Farmhouse Fig by Modern Farmhouse Family!</strong> This fall, cozy scent is officially out <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/farmhouse-fig-by-modern-farmhouse-family">NOW</a><strong>!</strong> THANK YOU to those that were able to test the new candle &amp; provide feedback for the collaboration candle with Sarah. The candle that “won” with some pretty exciting scores and categories was called “Farmhouse Harvest” originally. With your comments, thoughts, and hopping on a call with Sarah, this candle really should be accurately called "<strong>Farmhouse Fig</strong>".</p>
<p class="p1">This candle has top notes of dark plum, ripe blackberries, and crisp rhubarb. The fig leaf middle notes with a touch of rose bud &amp; jasmine petals is met with a woodsy &amp; deep foliage undertone. The fig carries through a space &amp; is so richly delighting, and the deep fruits make this feel home-y cozy and is strong – it will fill up an open concept home. Which is what inspired the name: Farmhouse Fig by Modern Farmhouse Family.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what some of the candle testers said about this one:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">
<span class="s1"></span><em><span class="s2">“My personal favorite was Farmhouse Harvest all around! It smells very inviting and like a “home”, not just a house.”</span> </em>
</li>
<li class="li2"><em> <span class="s1"></span><span class="s2">“The 'hot-throw' strength of the fragrance was just right after the candle was burning for 1-2 hours.”</span> </em></li>
<li class="li2"><em> <span class="s1"></span><span class="s2">I want to thank you so much for letting me try out your candles! It was pure joy!</span> </em></li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/MFF1_480x480.jpg?v=1689091052"></div>
<p class="p1">We are SO excited to have teamed up with Sarah + her sweet family, and develop this collaboration candle together! As part of the process of nailing down the perfect candle, we were so excited to read through the candle testing results. Now, we will focus our attention at making lots of these yummy <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/farmhouse-fig-by-modern-farmhouse-family">Farmhouse Fig candles</a> so you can enjoy it in your home this season. </p>
<p class="p1">By the way, if you like the idea of candle testing, be sure you are subscribed to our email or texting buddy lists. We have a few candle testing rounds each year, which are very limited time events – with sign ups only available for about a week. It’s easy to miss, so stay in the know here:</p>

    <title>And The New Pumpkin Candles Are...</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>Hi! It’s Brittany, again—owner &amp; founder of Antique Candle Co.®. I've got such an exciting update on my quest to find THREE new pumpkin candles for fall... </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/what-should-the-new-pumpkin-candles-be">Remember my blog</a>, asking what pumpkin fragrances we should create??</strong> Thank you so much for your thoughts on all things Pumpkin candles. I had so much fun thinking about all the ideas you shared with me. At the time of writing this, I read through almost 500 opinions, comments, and exciting ideas! ❤️ Sweet Pumpkin? Spicy Pumpkin? Sweet &amp; spice-y? Adding other flavors? The possibilities were endless. Some of the wackiest &amp; most creative ideas I read were: Pumpkin Pecan Waffles, White Chocolate Pumpkin, and Pumpkin Bourbon (which all sound DELISH). 😍</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Styled_Production_BTS_Shoot__image_85_1024x1024.png?v=1687534893"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><meta charset="utf-8"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<span>There were hundreds of </span><strong>amazing</strong><span> suggestions, but a few really stood out to me as potentially AMAZING pumpkin candles. </span>Currently, I've narrowed it down to 5 of my favorite... I'm letting my team take it from here to sniff + quality test these five fragrances. Based on their feedback, we will have three pumpkin winners (winner winner, pumpkin dinner?! 🤣). <strong>Ready to find out the five fragrances we are testing? </strong>

<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Pumpkin Apple</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Pumpkin Spice Latte</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Pumpkin Cake</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Sweet Pumpkin</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Pumpkin Patch</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">I think I was surprised the most by the apple with pumpkin aroma – I wouldn’t think to put those together in ways that you thought of! We're going to get to work on the apple, coffee, and sweet notes to try and make the PERFECT collection of PUMPKIN candles. How fun is this??? I must admit, it’s possible along the way we might not be able to nail all of these down in time. So if you have any other ideas that come to mind for this fall season, <strong>please leave a comment! </strong></p>

<p class="p1">I’m pretty excited about Fall &amp; we have already started making some <em><strong><a title="Fall Candles" href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/early-fall-release" target="_blank">fall candles</a></strong></em> that will launch in the coming months. Why are we making them so early? Well, keep in mind we are a small business – there is a small group of us making each candle. Wicking each one, printing on the jar, pouring &amp; cleaning the candle, placing a lid on it, putting it in inventory &amp; then placing it on the shelf for later. ❤️</p>
<p class="p1">However, we happen to be tracking ahead of schedule (BEST candle crew ever!!)…so I have released a few fall candles early.  We just haven’t made everything quite yet! Check out the fall candles we've made so far (m<span>ore to come pinky promise)</span>! 👇</p>

    <title>What should the new Pumpkin candles be?</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>Hey! 👋 It’s Brittany, again—owner &amp; founder of Antique Candle Co.®. 🥰</p>
<p>I LOVED reading through your comments on what we should make next (<a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/blogs/news/what-candle-should-we-create-next-please-help-me-pick">in this blog!</a>) —you helped me narrow down which BIG projects we should focus on! There were a few common themes I picked up from ya. THANK YOU for helping me sort through my creative (&amp; somewhat chaotic 😅) thoughts. <em>Phew!</em> I truly feel so much better. <strong>It just helps knowing what you would love!</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="float: none;" alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Styled_Production_BTS_Shoot__image_68_480x480.png?v=1684415576"></div>
<p>Funny story, speaking of candle feedback...I used to want a <em>tomato-scented candle</em>.🍅 Yes, you read that right! The fragrance smelled JUST like fresh garden vines and outdoor air with a very district, rich cherry tomato smell. HEAVENLY! I loved it so much that I made it into a candle and sent it out for testers YEARS ago. I’m glad I asked for opinions because almost <em>no one</em> loved it other than me! I was horrified—haha! How hilarious is that? 😂 <strong>Since then, I always ask for feedback</strong>...Although, you bet your bottom dollar that I made a dozen tomato candles for myself! That glorious, fresh garden tomato scent filled my house for about a year before I ran out of my stash...</p>
<p>Sorry—got on a bit of a tangent! My social studies teacher DID call me Blabby Brittany in class…(Hi, Mr. Walter!👨‍🏫) Okay, really moving on....</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So here’s what I heard you say <em>the most</em> a few weeks ago</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MELTS (please!!)</li>
<li>Pumpkin—gimme ALL the pumpkin!</li>
<li>Multi-wicks &amp; wood wicks!</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Candlesreadyfornewhome" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20220809_175751370_480x480.jpg?v=1683640666"></p>
<p>What really stood out to me was the enthusiasm for <strong><em>Pumpkin!</em> 🎃 </strong>Since we're planning for Fall right now, I want to hang out in the Pumpkin candle space for a bit. I’ve never made another pumpkin candle other than our wildly popular Pumpkin Spice fragrance. It’s literally the perfect candle, and one of my favorites (besides <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/products/pineapple-coconut-16-oz-candle">Pineapple Coconut</a>🍍). I’ve been making it since the early candle makin’ days in my kitchen. I must admit, I’m pretty excited about MORE Pumpkin candles!!</p>
<p><em>I have two questions for ya if you can please leave a comment with your opinion below!</em> I SO appreciate your thoughts to help with the creative direction:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<strong>1. <span style="color: #f98006;">What should the new Pumpkin candles be?</span> What fragrances sound AMAZING to you?</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Here’s a few that I’m thinking, but ANY and ALL Pumpkin ideas are welcome! 😊<strong><br></strong>
</div>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><em>White Pumpkin</em></li>
<li><em>Pumpkin Apple Cinnamon</em></li>
<li><em>Pumpkin Spice Latte</em></li>
<li><em>Pumpkin Cake</em></li>
<li><em>Pumpkin Apple</em></li>
<li><em>Sweet Pumpkin</em></li>
<li><em>Pumpkin Patch</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. <span style="color: #f98006;">Instead of our typical candle testing round, should we try something new?</span> Test in our studio &amp; release 3-5 high quality 'Pumpkin' candles for a limited time?</strong> I probably couldn’t make ALL of them forever...but releasing a few for a limited time would allow you to try them all, or just the ones that sound good to you! 😍</p>
<p>In our candle testing rounds, we typically pick just <em>one</em> winner that is most loved. It’s always a little sad doing that because everyone has their favorites. <em>Remember my tomato candle story I shared earlier?</em> I was able to make some tomato candles for me, but if I didn’t know how to make candles I would be SO BUMMED we didn't release it! Launching several new Pumpkin fragrances would allow everyone to truly get a fill of their FAVORITES for the season! 🎃🙌</p>
<ul></ul>

<p>As for timing, I’m thinking we do this Pumpkin🎃 thing in the middle of Fall. Say, September or October? OR is it too crazy to say...JUNE!? Kidding, but not kidding... 😂 What can I say? I'm a Pumpkin girl through and through. I'd burn them ALL year, <strong>but I’ll wait to hear your thoughts and then get to work.</strong></p>
<p>This has been so fun! Can’t wait to <em>Pumpkin</em><em> it up</em>. In the mean time, I’ll keep thinking and working on the other new BIG candle ideas.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Let me know your thoughts in the comments:</strong></h4>

      <![CDATA[<p class="">Brittany here! 🤗 <em>(CEO &amp; Founder of ACC!)</em></p>
<p class="">I wanted to personally thank ALL Candle Testers that tested four potential Spring fragrances in your homes the past several weeks! We've been having SO much fun reading through your rankings, comments, and suggestions. The survey ended &amp; we collected TONS of feedback and votes as they came—each one counts!</p>
<p class="">Check out this pic I took of our Product Development team working on alllll things fragrance! 👇</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20230411_182004351_600x600.jpg?v=1682449541" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p class="">Based on your honest responses, the NEW Spring Candle that will launch <em>in less than a month</em> is…..</p>
<h4><strong>🌸 <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/jasmine-peony">JASMINE PEONY!</a> 🌸</strong></h4>
<p class=""><strong>Here's what a few testers had to say about this candle:</strong></p>
<p class=""><span><em>"It has an absolutely heavenly aroma. It is fresh and strong without overpowering the space. It is the most fabulous candle I have ever experienced.</em>❣️<em>"</em></span></p>
<p class=""><em>"Airy, fresh scent like I walked out of my neighborhood on a spring morning!"</em></p>
<p class=""><em>"Such a perfect blend of floral and citrus. It’s a wonderful floral without being overpowering."</em></p>
<p class=""><span><em>"Jasmine Peony is amazing! My very favorite! It smells like memories of growing up, in my Pa-paw's garden!!! He grew the most beautiful Peony's, and this candle captured those precious memories, in a jar!</em> 💕"</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Lifestyle-SCT_2023__image_7_600x600.png?v=1682449331" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p><strong>So what does Jasmine Peony smell like?</strong></p>
<p class=""><span><span class=" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvls4um6z83zz83zz87zz66zz72zuilz82zz81zz85zz77zz86zz83z9a2z77z5ns6kt"><em>It's a soothing bouquet of jasmine and peony with sweet florals and orange zest, finished with earthy notes of clove and driftwood. </em>🥰🥰 A little piece of HEAVEN, am I right??</span></span></p>
<p class=""><span><span class=" author-d-1gg9uz65z1iz85zgdz68zmqkz84zo2qovvls4um6z83zz83zz87zz66zz72zuilz82zz81zz85zz77zz86zz83z9a2z77z5ns6kt"><strong>Nearly 700 Candle Testers</strong> loved the overall quality of Jasmine Peony above the other three fragrances that were tested, giving it an average satisfaction score of <em>7.5 out of 9!</em> 🎉 For the throw strength, they also noted this is a <em>moderate to strong</em> fragrance—right in the SWEET SPOT for many candles. 👌</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/Lifestyle-SCT_2023__image_25_600x600.jpg?v=1682449785" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>

      <![CDATA[<p>Hey! It’s Brittany – owner &amp; founder of Antique Candle Co.®. 👋</p>
<p>I’m still here – very busy behind the scenes working on alllll the new candle things &amp; ensuring we are delivering exceptional experiences in all the ways. <strong>I truly appreciate you being here supporting my family business.</strong> ❤️ I have three brothers, a sister-in-law, AND a cousin that work here! Lots of amazing friends &amp; coworkers contribute in powerful ways, too, forming one big happy candle business. 🤗</p>
<p>I have a BIG UPDATE to share with you though…introducing our newest team member: <em>my husband, Dan!</em> He’s officially here for a short stint to work on some of our biggest company projects <strong>(new product sneak peeks ahead👇)</strong>! I took this photo yesterday; it’s his first full week at the candle business. 🥰</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20230424_165906119_600x600.jpg?v=1682372909" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/PXL_20230424_165857522_600x600.jpg?v=1682372915" alt=""></div>
<p>Dan was here as my biggest supporter <em>since Day 1</em> when I was making candles in my kitchen! 🥹 Back then, I started with antique candles before the (now classic)<span style="color: #2b00ff;"><strong><em> </em><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/16-oz-candles" style="color: #2b00ff;">Mason Jar candles</a>.</strong></span> Not much changed there – we are still turning the coolest, vintage pieces into <span style="color: #2b00ff;"><a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/antiquerestock" style="color: #2b00ff;">one-of-a-kind candles</a></span>! But as we approach a shocking <strong>10 years</strong> in business, I find myself asking, <em>“What should we craft next?”</em></p>
<p>I am feeling the itch to create something brand new and potentially different than we’ve ever done before.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve started dreaming BIG.</strong> </p>
<p>Along with a team, I’ve spent the last 9 years building recipes &amp; ingredients to make the perfect candle, but there's A LOT more to dive into! My hands are sweaty as I type this…..bear with me. 😅 Okay, so here is the current list of <strong>all my hopes &amp; dreams for Antique Candle Co.®</strong> in no particular ranking or order of interest. They would all be fun candle projects for me—a candle maker turned entrepreneur—to explore!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wood Wicks 🔥</strong> – We are in the midst of making these work with soy wax. Getting wood wicks &amp; natural soy wax to work together has been much more complicated than I originally thought. The recipe is finicky, &amp; I want to get this RIGHT! We did a true candle tester round a year ago, and the results were eye opening – <em>we had more work to do.</em> The team &amp; I are determined to become wood wick experts!</li>
<li>
<strong>2-wick or dare I say…3-wick candles! 🤯</strong> For those of us that LOVE a good, strong aroma that fills an entire home, we may have to burn 2, 3, or 4 candles. I want a big, <em>boujie</em> candle that has multi-wicks, a bigger melt pool, and will fill a house up FAST! Like 30 minutes fast, yo! 🤩 Multi-wick candles are totally new for us, but there is more to be explored here. ✌️✌️</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/8831/5233/files/FB_IMG_1677767391785_600x600.jpg?v=1682373040" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ok, this is a big one. Brace yourself:<strong> Bringing back wax melts</strong>. 🙌 It’s been a minute &amp; I didn’t think our candle lovin’ friends would miss this as much as they have. I’ve also been thinking about <em>wax melters</em> to pair with the wax melts – we could design &amp; create something really special that would be beautiful in a home. Perhaps something vintage, chippy, farmhouse…so many thoughts – I can’t even type them all! Eek! 😆</li>
<li>
<strong>Another vintage-inspired container candle</strong> like our <a href="https://antiquecandleco.com/collections/brass-candles">brass candles</a> or crocks. These aren’t true vintage antiques like our “antique candles”, but give a look that embraces that vibe. LOVE!</li>
<li>
<strong>Almost every Pumpkin fragrance under the SUN!</strong> I want every👏single👏Pumpkin👏candle👏. I'll admit, this idea has my attention – White Pumpkin, Pumpkin Spice Latte, Heirloom Pumpkin, Pumpkin Bread, Pumpkin Cupcake, Pumpkin Patch<em>….oh my heart.</em> Pumpkin Spice is one of my ALL-TIME favorites &amp; I just would love a house full of so many Pumpkin candle options. 🧡 What if we had a ton of Pumpkin candles just for Fall? Right now we only make Pumpkin Spice. This would be a big time investment…<em>Would you be willing to help me test more pumpkin candles?</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do you think? Yay or nay?</strong> </p>
<p>Which dreams should I explore next? Which idea stood out to you the most? As a true creative, I want to do it all STAT! However, there are only so many of us working on new, fun things at ACC so I need to prioritize. Which dream to do??? 🤔</p>
<p><em><strong>Hm…Will you please let me know on the blog via a comment?</strong></em> I would SO love to hear from you. I will read every comment myself...I feel the creative paralysis kicking in. Not to say I want to put all my hopes &amp; dreams into just one project <em>(I think I could pick a couple right now!)</em>, but I want to launch some new products this upcoming Fall season. Let’s be real, I burn candles all year long (and maybe you do, too!), but we really start to get busy when Pumpkin Spice season rolls around. 😉 You get my drift….</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this far if you made it! ❤️ I felt inspired to bring some of these thoughts to you – a fellow candle lover. I would love to bring most of these ideas to life – crafting, planning, building, and eventually making these &amp; shipping to your home would be a dream. One of the things I love most about my job is helping YOU create warm, cozy spaces for your family in your home, and these ideas would help me do just that. Family means everything to me, so I know what it means for friends like you! 🤗</p>
<p><strong>Would you take a second to leave a comment and let me know your thoughts?</strong> Any help with this creative paralysis would go a long way!</p>

<p><span>We don’t go by Antique Candle Co.® just for funzies…🤣 </span>We LOVE a good ol' fashioned antique! It IS in our name, after all... If you're new here, you might be wondering WHY we call ourselves Antique Candle Co.®? The answer goes WAY BACK to 2014! When Brittany, Owner &amp; Founder, first started hand-pourin' candles, she poured them into beautiful antiques! 💕</p>

<p><span>To keep the tradition alive, we now restock these beauties once a month in an Antique Restock! ✨ We hand-pour their thrifts + findings in to <strong>STUNNING</strong> vintage candles and make them available to YOU! </span></p>

<p><span>A few times a year, our fearless leader &amp; boss babe (Brittany!) + her mom head out on antique road trips across the mid-west to find the most unique and sought-after vessels to make into DELICIOUS cozy candles! ❤️ Most of our antique vessels are thrifted by our own candle crew with a </span><em>little</em><span> help from close family &amp; friends.</span><br><br><span>Once we have enough antiques on our shelves, our talented Antique Restock Manager, Emily, makes hundreds (sometimes, thousands!) of candles for what we call our Antique Restocks. ✨ </span></p>
